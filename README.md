# MEDUSA

Womenâ€™s safety is the prime concern in view of the latest incidents that have occurred in
various parts of our country. Due to unavailability of proper help, it becomes very difficult for
the victim or a person to cope up with the situation. 
In order to tackle and to avoid any
unusual incidences we made Medusa

Medusa is a Dynamic web project for women safety and security with auto location tracking and many other features!
